# Fine Uploader ASP.NET Core 2 Example for Azure Blob Storage
This example was taken directly from another author's example posted here:
https://github.com/ellavs/Fine-Uploader-ASP.NET-Core-2-Example

I modified the code to put the file in Azure Blob Storage, and I set the temporary directory to a relative path within the project / site so that the temp file copy will work out-of-the-box in Azure App Service and locally.
